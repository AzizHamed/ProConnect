### Home Page

After finishing the profile setup, you'll be redirected to the home page, where you can look for professionals in different professions and look at articles.

Notice the side bar, which you can open by clicking on the hamburger menu on mobile and is always visible on web, where you can either go to your profile, change your theme preference, log out, or go back to the home page.

Notice that Homeowner accounts have a Post tab on the bottom navigation bar, while Professionals have a Jobs tab.

#### Navigation Tab Bar

The navigation tab bar contains three tabs:

1. Home, which we've already seen.
2. Chat, a page where you can see all the chats you've had and access the conversations, and
3. Either a Post tab or a Jobs tab
   * **Homeowners:** Homeowners have access to the Post tab, where they can publish new posts about jobs they require help with
   * **Professionals:** Professionals have access to the Jobs tab, where they can browse through posts in their particular profession and look for something they'd like to work on.

#### Profession Search Bar

At the top of the Home page, you'll find a search bar where you can enter your desired profession and look for professionals in that profession in the "Find Professionals" page.

### Find Professionals Page

Clicking on one of these professionals will open up a Chat conversation with them, while clicking on their profile picture will open up their profile![1715122872081](image/UserGuide/1715122872081.png)![1715122959017](image/UserGuide/1715122959017.png)

### Profile

When viewing another user's profile, you'll be able to see information about the user such as contact information, rating, as well as their profession, services and experience in the case that they are a professional user. You'll also notice that you can open a chat conversation or rate the user from the top right corner of the profile.

When viewing your own profile, however, instead you'll see an edit button which will take you back to the profile setup page where you can change any of your information
